# covid_predict

## For anyone wishing to extend this project
REQUIRED: Check out intro to problem. It gives a visual description of the problem. 
This is by nature very open ended. I may be unclear sometimes on what the exact problem is. That’s because I’m not sure myself what the exact problem is. It’s partially up to you to decide how to best predict covid deaths and spread. What exactly is “best” is a hard question to answer even by itself. 

## What this will teach you
How to work with basic data pipelines, how to create models, and how to backtest them. 

Recommended fluency in libraries:
Pandas, Numpy, Scipy

## Summary of what this contains
folder ‘data’: Datasets of covid deaths, spread, and other related factors.
folder ’submissions’: a sample submission to check format and an evaluator that implements pinball loss for a submission. 
folder ‘code’: starter models/plotting code, starter data loading/preprocessing code, and starter code to output submission files.

## Limitations
No code to update any data. Starter datasets and many others are updated fairly often. You’ll have to write your own update scripts. 

No real documentation. Look for it in code comments, which are somewhat inconsistent.

Limited starter datasets. It’s on you to find these. Find urls for recommended datasets in ‘data’.
